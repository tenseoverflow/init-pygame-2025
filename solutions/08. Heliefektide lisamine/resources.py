# But our game needs more sounds! Load your sounds here.
# We have provided sound effects for the gameplay ambience (ambience.wav),
# fruits and bombs being thrown (throw.wav and bomb_throw.wav),
# bomb explosion (kaboom.wav), missing a fruit (miss.wav),
# slicing a fruit (slice.wav), and the main game soundtrack (soundtrack.wav).
# You can also use your own sounds, any MP3 or WAV file should work fine!
